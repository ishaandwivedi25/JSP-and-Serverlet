this is divided into 4 parts

1,2,3,4

All four are different questions,in the order:-

1. Client sends user name and password to JSP on the Server. Server receives, validates and
sends back the validation result to client as response.
2. Create a JSP page for an online multiple choice test. The questions are randomly selected
from a database and displayed on the screen. The choices are displayed using radio buttons.
When the user clicks on next, the next question is displayed. When the user clicks on submit,
display the total score on the screen.
3. Write a servlet which counts how many times a user has visited a web page. If the user is
visiting the page for the first time, display a welcome message. If the user is re-visiting the
page, display the number of times visited. (Use cookies)
4. Write a program to create a shopping mall. User must be allowed to do purchase from two
pages. Each page should have a page total. The third page should display a bill, which consists
of a page total of whatever the purchase has been done and print the total. (Use HttpSession)
